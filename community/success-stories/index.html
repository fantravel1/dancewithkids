              <p style="margin: 8px 0 0; font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Maya's Journey: Age 6, Boston, USA</p>
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 32px;">
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <strong style="color: #0E0E1A;">"Maya wouldn't even wave at her own birthday party."</strong> Her mom, Jessica, describes those early years. "She was brilliant, kind, but invisible in her own skin. She'd hide behind my legs when other kids were playing."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                A friend recommended DanceWithKids. Jessica was skeptical. "My daughter doesn't dance. She doesn't really do anything physical."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                But something about the Easy level routines drew Maya in. Short. Simple. No judgment. She started with 30 seconds of bouncing. Then a minute. Then she was asking to dance every morning.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                By month three, Jessica witnessed something she'd never seen: Maya dancing unprompted, in front of the living room window, visible to the whole street. "I cried," Jessica says. "Not sad tears. Proud-mama tears."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9;">
                <strong>Six months later:</strong> Maya led her entire kindergarten class in a dance routine. She stood in front. She smiled. She owned it. "DanceWithKids didn't teach her choreography," Jessica says. "It taught her that her body is worth celebrating."
              </p>

              <p style="margin: 8px 0 0; font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">The Chen Family: Ages 5, 35, and 67. San Francisco, USA</p>
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 32px;">
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                When Wei's mom moved in after her stroke, the family struggled. Three generations, one apartment, and nobody quite knew how to connect across the age gaps.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Five-year-old Kai wanted Grandma to play. Grandma was recovering, limited in mobility. Wei and his partner worked long hours.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                "My wife found DanceWithKids and showed me the chair dance option," Wei recalls. "I thought, 'Okay, this is cute but it won't work for us.'"
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                They tried Family Mode. Kai did the full moves. Wei and his partner adapted the choreography. Grandma sat in her favorite chair and moved her arms, her hips, swaying gently.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                "That first dance session, Grandma smiled bigger than I'd seen since her stroke," Wei says, voice catching. "Not the polite smile. The real one."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9;">
                <strong>One year later:</strong> Friday night Family Dance Night is sacred. The whole household gathers. Grandma has regained mobility and now moves more than she sits. Kai sees his grandmother as strong and capable. And Wei and his family have something precious: time together that doesn't feel like work or obligation. It feels like joy.

              <h2 style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.8em;">A Teacher's Breakthrough Moment</h2>
              <p style="margin: 8px 0 0; font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Ms. Rodriguez's PE Class: Elementary School, Miami, USA</p>
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 32px;">
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Ms. Rodriguez taught PE for 15 years and loved it. But something always bothered her: the kids who sat on the sidelines. The ones who said they "couldn't dance." Or "weren't athletic." Or "didn't want to."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                "Dance was where the confident kids got confident and the shy kids got more withdrawn," she explains.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                A colleague told her about DanceWithKids. Ms. Rodriguez integrated it into her curriculum. She set one rule: everyone participates, but everyone chooses their level.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                "The first day, Carlos — super athletic, soccer star — chose Easy level. Marcus — quiet, struggles with coordination — chose it too. Suddenly, choosing Easy wasn't embarrassing; it was smart," she recalls.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                By week three, the transformation was visible. Kids weren't competing. They were celebrating each other's effort. Marcus was smiling. Carlos was encouraging him.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9;">
                "At the end of the unit, my principal observed and pulled me aside. She said, 'I've never seen our kids interact like this. What are you doing?' It wasn't me," Ms. Rodriguez says. "It was a system that made every kid feel like they belonged."
              </p>

              <h2 style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.8em;">Finding Her Voice Through Movement</h2>
              <p style="margin: 8px 0 0; font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.9;">Emma's Story: Age 9, Autism Spectrum, London, UK</p>
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 32px;">
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; font-size: 1.05em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Emma is autistic. She's brilliant, creative, and deeply communicative — but not always with words. Sometimes, she needs predictability, low stimulation, and space to process at her own speed.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Her mum discovered DanceWithKids and the sensory-friendly mode. "The first thing that got me was the predictability," her mum says. "Every routine has the same structure. Every video cues the same way. Emma knew what to expect."
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Emma started with Instrumental routines. No lyrics, no surprises, just rhythm. She danced for 90 seconds at a time and loved it.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Six months in, something remarkable happened. Emma started creating her own dance combinations. Then, she started explaining her movements to her siblings. Movement was becoming language.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.9;">
                "Emma will never love small talk or loud parties," her mum says. "But she found a way to express herself, to be seen, to take up space. For a kid who struggled to feel comfortable in her own body, dance became a way home. That's everything."
              </p>
